# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a game that will allow children to learn about various birds of different categories
through an interactive game experience.  The game will consist of the demonstration of an osprey's food acquisition, nest building,
and migration.  There will also be a red knot game that consists of the bird's food acquisition and nest building process.
